WHAT LOOKS GOOD ON THIS USER (Style Profile):
- Best colors: ${bestColors.join(', ')}
${avoidColors.length > 0 ? `- Avoid colors: ${avoidColors.join(', ')}` : ''}
- Style categories: ${styleCategories.join(', ')}
- Aesthetic: ${aestheticKeywords.join(', ')}
- Recommended patterns: ${recommendedPatterns.join(', ')}
${avoidPatterns.length > 0 ? `- Avoid patterns: ${avoidPatterns.join(', ')}` : ''}

TASK:
Rate how good this item will look on the user from 1-10. Be VERY STRICT and critical, and base your judgment on how well the visible qualities align with what tends to flatter this user (colors, patterns, silhouettes, aesthetic cues):
- 1-3: Likely unflattering for this user (major conflicts with colors, silhouette, aesthetic, or patterns)
- 4-6: Mixed or neutral (some flattering aspects but notable conflicts or uncertainties)
- 7-8: Will likely look good (aligns well with most flattering attributes, minor caveats)
- 9-10: Will look great (exceptional alignment with flattering colors, patterns, and aesthetic â€” award sparingly)

Be critical and selective. Most items should score 1-8. Only give 9-10 to items that are TRULY exceptional for this user.

ADDITIONALLY, provide a detailed description of this clothing item for virtual try-on image generation. Focus on:
- Type of garment (e.g., dress, shirt, pants, jacket, skirt)
- Colors (primary and secondary colors, patterns)
- Style details (cut, silhouette - e.g., A-line, bodycon, wrap, shift, straight-leg)
- **FIT & SIZE DETAILS** (VERY IMPORTANT):
  * Fit: tight/fitted/slim/regular/relaxed/loose/oversized/baggy
  * Length: cropped/short/knee-length/midi/maxi/ankle-length/floor-length/mini
  * Rise (for bottoms): low-rise/mid-rise/high-rise
  * Sleeve length: sleeveless/short-sleeve/three-quarter/long-sleeve
  * Overall proportions: how the garment sits on the body
- Material appearance (e.g., denim, cotton, leather, knit, silk, satin, chiffon)
- Key design features (e.g., buttons, zippers, pockets, ruffles, pleats, neckline style)
- Pattern/texture (e.g., solid, striped, floral, plaid, textured, ribbed)
- Overall aesthetic (e.g., casual, formal, sporty, bohemian, minimalist, vintage)

Respond in this exact format:
SCORE: [number 1-10]
REASON: [brief 1-2 sentence explanation focused on why it will (or will not) look good on this user, explicitly referencing 2-3 concrete factors from the profile such as best/avoid colors, recommended/avoid patterns, and aesthetic fit]
DESCRIPTION: [2-3 sentence detailed outfit description capturing all visual details, especially fit and length]

Example response:
SCORE: 8
REASON: Navy blazer aligns with best colors and classic aesthetic; structured, waist-length cut flatters proportions.
DESCRIPTION: Navy blue fitted blazer in a structured cotton-blend fabric with notched lapels and silver button closure. Features long sleeves with functional cuff buttons and a cropped length hitting at the waist. Slim, tailored fit with two front flap pockets and classic professional aesthetic.`;

USER IS LOOKING FOR: "${userPrompt}"

TASK:
Rate how well this item matches the user's specific request from 1-3:
- 1 (NO): Does not match the request at all (wrong item type, color, or style)
- 2 (MAYBE): Partially matches but missing key attributes from the request
- 3 (YES): Strong match - closely matches what the user is looking for

Be DECISIVE and specific. Consider ONLY what is visible:
- Item type match (e.g., if user wants "dress", this should be a dress)
- Color match (if user specifies color like "black", check if this matches)
- Style attributes (e.g., "A-line", "casual", "formal", "running")
- Pattern or material (if visible in the image)
- Overall visual relevance to the search query

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Base your decision solely on what you can see in the image
- Ignore alt text and any external text
- If the image clearly matches the request: score 3
- If the image clearly conflicts with the request: score 1
- If information is limited or ambiguous: score 2

Respond in this exact format:
SCORE: [number 1, 2, or 3]
