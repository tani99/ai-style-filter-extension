# Score Display & Debug Update

## Changes Made

### 1. Score Badge Display - Fixed ✅
**Changed:** Badge now shows just the number (e.g., "5" instead of "5/10")

**Visual Changes:**
- Larger font (18px instead of 14px)
- More padding (8px 12px)
- Minimum width for consistency
- Centered text

### 2. Enhanced Score Source Logging ✅
**Added detailed logging to show where each score came from:**

For each product, console will now show:
```javascript
📊 Product 1: {
    score: 8,
    source: "🤖 AI",              // or "⚠️ DEFAULT" if fallback
    reasoning: "Navy dress matches classic style perfectly",
    method: "ai_analysis",         // or "fallback" / "error_fallback"
    cached: false,
    success: true,
    productAlt: "Navy midi dress"
}
```

### 3. Score Breakdown Summary ✅
**Added summary showing score sources:**

After all products are analyzed:
```javascript
✅ Product analysis complete: {
    totalProducts: 12,
    averageScore: "7.3",
    scoreBreakdown: {
        fromAI: 12,          // How many from actual AI analysis
        fromDefault: 0,      // How many using default score 5
        fromCache: 0         // How many from cache
    },
    cacheStats: {...}
}
```

### 4. Warning for Default Scores ✅
If any products receive default scores (5/10), you'll see:
```
⚠️ WARNING: 3 products received DEFAULT scores instead of AI analysis!
   This usually means AI analysis failed. Check logs above for errors.
```

## Why You're Seeing All 5/10 Scores

The score "5" with reasoning "AI not available - neutral score" is a **fallback default** that happens when:

1. **AI is not initialized** - ProductAnalyzer couldn't create AI session
2. **AI API failed** - Chrome AI threw an error during analysis
3. **AI returned invalid response** - Response couldn't be parsed

## How to Debug

### Step 1: Reload Extension
```
chrome://extensions/ → Click reload 🔄
```

### Step 2: Check Console Logs

Look for these specific indicators:

#### ✅ SUCCESS - AI Working:
```
🔧 Initializing ProductAnalyzer...
✅ Chrome AI API detected
🔍 AI Availability: {available: "readily"}
✅ ProductAnalyzer initialized successfully

📊 Product 1: {
    score: 8,
    source: "🤖 AI",           ← This means AI generated it!
    method: "ai_analysis",
    ...
}

✅ Product analysis complete: {
    scoreBreakdown: {
        fromAI: 12,              ← All 12 from AI!
        fromDefault: 0,          ← Zero defaults!
        fromCache: 0
    }
}
```

#### ❌ PROBLEM - All Defaults:
```
❌ Chrome AI not available for product analysis
   window.ai: undefined

📊 Product 1: {
    score: 5,
    source: "⚠️ DEFAULT",      ← Fallback score!
    method: "fallback",
    reasoning: "AI not available - neutral score"
}

⚠️ WARNING: 12 products received DEFAULT scores instead of AI analysis!
```

### Step 3: Check What the Logs Say

The console will now clearly show for EACH product:

**If you see `source: "🤖 AI"`** → Score came from actual AI analysis ✅

**If you see `source: "⚠️ DEFAULT"`** → Score is the fallback (5/10) ❌

### Step 4: Common Reasons for All 5/10 Scores

1. **Chrome AI Not Available**
   - Look for: `❌ Chrome AI not available for product analysis`
   - Solution: Enable Chrome AI (see below)

2. **AI Model Not Downloaded**
   - Look for: `⚠️ AI model not readily available: after-download`
   - Solution: Wait for download, try again in 5-10 minutes

3. **AI Session Creation Failed**
   - Look for: `❌ Failed to initialize ProductAnalyzer`
   - Look for error details in stack trace

4. **AI Prompt Failed**
   - Look for: `❌ Product analysis failed`
   - Look for error message after each product analysis

## Enable Chrome AI (if needed)

### Check Chrome Version
```
chrome://settings/help
```
Need Chrome 128 or later.

### Enable AI Flags
1. **Prompt API:**
   ```
   chrome://flags/#prompt-api-for-gemini-nano
   → Set to "Enabled"
   ```

2. **Model Download:**
   ```
   chrome://flags/#optimization-guide-on-device-model
   → Set to "Enabled BypassPerfRequirement"
   ```

3. **Restart Chrome**

4. **Verify AI is Ready:**
   Open console on any page and run:
   ```javascript
   (async () => {
       const status = await window.ai?.languageModel?.capabilities();
       console.log('AI Status:', status);
       // Should show: {available: "readily"}
   })();
   ```

## Quick Test After Reload

After reloading the extension, go to a shopping site and look for this in console:

**Good (AI working):**
```
📊 Product 1: {score: 8, source: "🤖 AI", ...}
📊 Product 2: {score: 6, source: "🤖 AI", ...}
📊 Product 3: {score: 9, source: "🤖 AI", ...}

✅ Product analysis complete: {
    scoreBreakdown: {fromAI: 12, fromDefault: 0, ...}
}
```

**Bad (Fallback scores):**
```
📊 Product 1: {score: 5, source: "⚠️ DEFAULT", method: "fallback", ...}
📊 Product 2: {score: 5, source: "⚠️ DEFAULT", method: "fallback", ...}

⚠️ WARNING: 12 products received DEFAULT scores instead of AI analysis!
```

## What You'll See Now

1. **Score badges show just the number** (e.g., "8" not "8/10")
2. **Console clearly labels each score source** (🤖 AI or ⚠️ DEFAULT)
3. **Summary shows how many AI vs default scores**
4. **Warning if any defaults detected**

This will immediately tell you if the problem is:
- AI not initializing
- AI analysis failing
- Scores actually working but all products happen to score 5

**Please reload the extension and share what you see in the console for the score breakdown!**
