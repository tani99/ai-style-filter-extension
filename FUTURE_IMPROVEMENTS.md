# Future Improvements & Feature Ideas

## User Experience Enhancements

### 1. Style Profile Missing Indicator
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Not Implemented

**Problem**: When users visit e-commerce sites without creating a style profile first, they see green borders around clothing items but no style scores. This is confusing because there's no indication that they need to create a profile first.

**Proposed Solution**:
Add a visual indicator/banner when no style profile exists:
- Show a floating banner/notification on e-commerce sites
- Message: "Create your style profile to see personalized product scores"
- Include a button: "Create Profile" that opens the extension dashboard
- Auto-dismiss after user creates a profile
- Optional: Show a small badge on the extension icon indicating profile status

**Implementation Ideas**:
```javascript
// In content-consolidated.js, after checking for style profile:
if (!this.userStyleProfile) {
    this.showStyleProfilePrompt();
}

showStyleProfilePrompt() {
    const banner = document.createElement('div');
    banner.className = 'ai-style-profile-prompt';
    banner.innerHTML = `
        <div style="...">
            ðŸ“¸ Create your style profile to see personalized product scores!
            <button id="create-profile-btn">Create Profile</button>
            <button id="dismiss-banner">Dismiss</button>
        </div>
    `;
    document.body.appendChild(banner);

    // Add click handlers
    document.getElementById('create-profile-btn').addEventListener('click', () => {
        chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ action: 'openStyleDashboard' });
    });
}
```

**Files to Modify**:
- `content/content-consolidated.js` - Add banner logic
- `content/ui/` - Create new `ProfilePrompt.js` module (if using modular structure)
- `background/background.js` - Handle `openStyleDashboard` message
- Add CSS for banner styling

- Always prioritize features from the original implementation plan (Steps 5.2, 6, 7, 8) before adding new features
